Examples and documentation for Trello's Butler allowing you to automate your workflow in plain English

## Getting Started

These are several light weight (a.k.a *wildwest*- no builds, test, tools, or folders for quick plug and play (: ), single page examples of how you could use Trello's Butler. Each example will have a unique Trello link that you will have to generate on your own.  (https://bot.trellobutler.com/scripts/XXXXXXX)

The Examples will take advantage of programming helper libraries such as Jquery, Underscore & Bootstrap.
